Dr Onah, a native born of Nigeria is an academic of strong international standing in Computer Science and Computer Systems Engineering (Software Systems). Dr Onah received his first degree in BSc. Computer Science from University of Uyo in Nigeria and received the MSc (Eng.) degree in Computer Systems Engineering with specialisation in Software Systems from the University of East London, United Kingdom in 2011. He is currently a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, United Kingdom. Dr Onah is a member of the Intelligent & Adaptive Systems Research Group in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Warwick. His research focuses on educational technology and the design of e-learning systems and adaptive software systems. He has designed a stand-alone MOOC platform called eLDa as part of the tool for his Doctorate research investigation. Dr Onah has produced over 18 publications to date and currently working on some publications in-progress on his research. His research has been recognised nationally and internationally by researchers, academics, professionals and have been cited in several international journals and conference publications. Dr Onah has chaired sessions at several international conferences, blind-peer-reviewed academic papers (Journals & Conferences) and is a member of programme committees for many conferences. Dr Onah in June 2017 visited King’s College London, Instructional Design and Development, King’s Online department as a visiting researcher. During Dr Onah’s visit, he initiated a collaborative opportunity with the team on adaptive systems and other related research interests. Dr Onah at the end of June 2017 visited University College London, Department of Computer Science as a visiting researcher.  The discussion during Dr Onah’s visit was on his recent research on eLDa MOOC and also on a collaborative project on the evaluation of learners acceptability of an existing online system done in partnership with other European partner institutions. We discussed potential project and a specific area of research collaboration.

Dr Onah has been short-listed thrice for the Warwick Award for Teaching Excellence over three consecutive academic years (2014/2015, 2015/2016 and 2016/2017). Dr Onah is an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA), United Kingdom. He has also successfully received the Postgraduate Award Certificate in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education (PGA-TLHE) from the Higher Education Academy (HEA), UK and The University of Warwick in 2015.  Dr Onah also received a Postgraduate Certificate in Transferable Skills in Science (PGCTSS) from the University of Warwick in 2015. Dr Onah is a member of Computing at School (CAS) for teachers in United Kingdom and the Association for Learning Technology (ALT), where most of his members are engaging in the eLDa platform he created for free. During his doctorate training, Dr Onah, was the Postgraduate Research (PGR) Student Staff Liaison Committee (SSLC) representative for international students (for two academic years 2014/2015 and 2015/2016). During his Master’s program, he investigated the application of formal methods in air traffic control systems, where he developed an aircraft control simulation system. Dr Onah graduated top of his class (top 5%) with Distinction from University of East London in 2011. He worked briefly in the University of East London as a European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) Tutor and IT systems Engineer. He also worked as a Software Developer (using Visual Studio .NET, C#, VB, website development) and as a Database Developer/Administrator (using SQL, MySQL) with the Employability and Enterprise Team (EET) of University of East London. During his Doctorate programme he worked part time as a Temporary IT Technician with the Campus Commercial Services Group (CCSG) at the University of Warwick. Dr Onah has a wide range of industrial experience. One of his memorable achievement after completing his MSc degree, was during the London 2012 Olympics games, Dr Onah was among the 12-Man IT coordinators and was awarded a medal after the games.
In December 2017 Dr Onah’s PhD project ‘eLDa’ was shortlisted for an imagine education e-learning awards in Philadelphia  USA. In November 2017 a collaborative project between Dr Onah (then in Warwick) with American University in the Emerates titled: Adaptable Road Navigation System was shortlisted for The Institute of Engineering & Technology (IET) Innovation Awards 2017 London and we were ‘Highly Commended’.
