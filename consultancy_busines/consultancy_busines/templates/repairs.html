        DANIEL ONAH, Ph.D.
        Biography
        Dr Onah, a native born of Nigeria is an academic of strong international
        standing in Computer Science and Computer Systems Engineering (Software
        Systems). Dr Onah received his first degree in BSc. Computer Science from
        University of Uyo in Nigeria and received the MSc (Eng.) degree in Computer
        Systems Engineering with specialisation in Software Systems from the
        University of East London, United Kingdom in 2011. He is currently a Teaching
        Assistant in the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, United
        Kingdom. Dr Onah is a member of the Intelligent & Adaptive Systems Research
        Group in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Warwick. His
        research focuses on educational technology and the design of e-learning systems
        and adaptive software systems. He has designed a stand-alone MOOC platform
        called eLDa as part of the tool for his Doctorate research investigation. Dr Onah
        has produced over 18 publications to date and currently working on some
        publications in-progress on his research. His research has been recognised
        nationally and internationally by researchers, academics, professionals and have
        been cited in several international journals and conference publications. Dr
        Onah has chaired sessions at several international conferences, blind-peer-
        reviewed academic papers (Journals & Conferences) and is a member of
        programme committees for many conferences. Dr Onah in June 2017 visited
        King’s College London, Instructional Design and Development, King’s Online
        department as a visiting researcher. During Dr Onah’s visit, he initiated a
        collaborative opportunity with the team on adaptive systems and other related
        research interests. Dr Onah at the end of June 2017 visited University College
        London, Department of Computer Science as a visiting researcher. The
        discussion during Dr Onah’s visit was on his recent research on eLDa MOOC
        and also on a collaborative project on the evaluation of learners acceptability of
        an existing online system done in partnership with other European partner
        institutions. We discussed potential project and a specific area of research
        collaboration.
